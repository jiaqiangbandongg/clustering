'''
choose k(number of clusters) and distance function

algorithm:
initialize k centroids by ranodm sampling k samples in full samples
for sample in full samples:
    calculate the distance between sample and each centroids by using distance function,\
    select the centroids which has the least distance with the sample and use its cluster as the sample's cluster
update the k centroids by using the mean of all corresponding samples
for and update again and again until any sample's cluster is not change or the loop count up to the appointed number.
